       Instructions
    </h1>
<br>
    <p>
        In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group
        of {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} participants for 6 periods.
        </p>
<p>

       <u>At each period:</u>
    </p>
        <p>Each participant will be given
         {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}. The group
        has the opportunity to undertake a joint project.  Each participant in
        the group decides how much she or he is going to contribute to
        the project. Contribution could be any integer from 0
        to {{ C.ENDOWMENT }}.
    </p>
    <p>
        The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: The
        contributions of all {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }} participants are
        added up, the total contribution
        is multiplied by a factor of {{ C.MULTIPLIER }}, and the
        resulting amount is the total earnings from the project, which is
        evenly split among all {{ C.PLAYERS_PER_GROUP }}
        participants. Your payoff equals your earnings from the project, plus
        the amount you did not contribute.
    </p>

<p>
        At the end of the experiment, your total payoff will correspond to the sum of the payoffs you accumulated over the 6 periods.
</p>
    <p>
    The participant with the highest total payoff will be given 5 euros next week!
